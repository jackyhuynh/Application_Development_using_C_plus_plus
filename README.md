# Robotic_Design_and_Development
 
## Why C++:
Speed, Reliable, Security 

## Why use C++ for robotic development:
- Program has a lot of fundamental
- Highlevel generic coding
- C++ is useful for learning tool for programming

## Where C++ is used:
- Networking, embedded, Animation, Digital devices, Cars, robotic

## Why C++ is different than other programming languages:
- Working directly with the hardware
- Working very efficientcy with the hardware.
- Not deal with lowlevel languages all the time and still be efficient.
