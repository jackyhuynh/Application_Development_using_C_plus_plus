## Why C++ (Speed, Reliable, Security): 
Why use C++ for robotic development and development? The C++ programing language has a lot of fundamentals and support. It is a high-level generic coding and is extremely useful as a learning tool for robotic programming. It is also the most reliable and fastest for robotic and embedded systems. The project consists of C++ fundamental and robotic movement exercises.

## Why use C++ for robotic development:
- Program has a lot of fundamental
- Highlevel generic coding
- C++ is useful for learning tool for programming

## Where C++ is used:
- Networking, embedded, Animation, Digital devices, Cars, robotic

## Why C++ is different than other programming languages:
- Working directly with the hardware
- Working very efficientcy with the hardware.
- Not deal with lowlevel languages all the time and still be efficient.
