## C++ Preprocessor Directives and the main function

Each C++ program consists of two parts: the preprocessor directives and the main function. 


    #include <iostream>

    int main() 
    {
        std::cout << "Hello world, I am ready for C++";
        return 0;
    }

The first line we encounter has a hash at the start of the line. Any line that has a hash sign at the start is a preprocessor directive.

    #include <iostream>

After the hash sign we have the word include. There are several preprocessor directives available in C++, but include is the one we see and use the most often.

Include means add the declarations of the given library. In this case we are adding the declarations of the iostream library.

The final detail of this line …. The brackets..

The brackets say “Look for this file in the directory where all the standard libraries are stored”. C++ also allows us to specify the library name using double quotes.

    #include "main.hpp"

The double quotes say “look in the current directory, if the file is not there, then look in the directory where the standard libraries are stored”.

If we change the brackets to double quotes, for this case, the program still compiles. We will see later in the course a situation where using the correct enclosure (Brackets or quotes) makes a difference.

The next section is the main section of the program. We will discuss this in more detail in the next concept.

    int main() 
    {
        std::cout << "Hello world, I am ready for C++";
        return 0;
    }

## How to use comment in C++:
- Comment is used to show how code is done not why it is done.

 Comments can be added in two ways:
As a comment block
As a single line
In the next node you will see the prompt for a "Hello World" program.

The prompt is enclosed in the symbols: '/*' and '*/'. This is how we signify comment block. For example:

     /*The start of a comment block.
     Everything between "/* "and " */ "
     is in the comment block.
     The end of a comment block.*/
For this course we are adding asterisks for each line of the comment block. It is not necessary, but we think it draws your attention to the comment block.

For example:

/*write a C++ program that outputs the following statement:
*** "Hello world, I am ready for C++"
*/
A comment can be added as a single line by preceding the comment with two slash marks.

For example the code snippet below has two comments. Each comment begins with two slash marks. :

int main()
{
    int year = 0;
    int age = 0;
    std::string name = " ";
    //print a message to the user <- this line is a comment
    std::cout<<"What year is your favorite? ";
    //get the user response and assign it to the year<- this line is a comment
    std::cin >> year;
    ...

## Progamming

### C++ Style Guide

As with all programming languages, there are many different ways to style the code we write. For this course, we are not using a standard style. We are trying to remain consistent throughout the course, while making the codes as readable as possible.

There are a number of style guides available, the best one is the one used by the people who are paying you.

A straightforward style guide is:
               [Modern C++ Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/coding_guidelines.md)

For a more detailed guideline:
               [Google C++ Style Guideline](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

### The g++ compiler:


    g++  main.cpp -o main.out

G++ for the C++ compiler. The file name is main.cpp. -o is for the name of the output. Main.out is the name of the output.

To run the output file, main.out.

We run:

    ./main.out

### Using namespace std

    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
    }
This tells the compiler to assume we are using the standard library, so we don’t have to write std::

### sizeof
For this programming assignment, you will be printing the size of different variable types. As with other programming languages, the size a variable is allocated in memory is dependent upon its type. To determine how many bytes each variable type uses, C++ provides the function sizeof(variableType).

You will use the command :

    sizeof(variable type) ie: sizeof(int)
When printing out the variable types, you may want to print them out, one per line.
To do this, add "\n" or "endl" to the end of the text to be printed.
For example:
This is the new line character.

    cout<<"int size = "<<sizeof(int)<<"\n";
A second option is:
"endl"

    cout<<"int size = "<<sizeof(int)<<endl;
In many instances endl and "\n" will perform the same function. There are cases where they will be different.
You can read a quick discussion about their differences here:
newline and endline differences

### Define Constants
In C++ we can define a variable as a constant. Meaning, its value does not change for the life of the program.

We use the keyword 'const' to define a constant.

 For example: 
           const int weightGoal = 100;

### enumerated constants (enum)
C++ also allows for enumerated constants. This means the programmer can create a new variable type and then assign a finite number of values to it. Here is the form of the enum keyword:

    enum type_name {
    value1,
    value2,
    value3,
    .
    .
    } object_names;

For example:

    enum MONTH {Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec};
In this example the enum variable MONTH has twelve possible values. These 12 values translate into 12 integer values.

    Jan = 0
    Feb = 1
    etc.

### iomanip()

To format data we can use escape sequences. These do not require any additional libraries.

The C++ escape sequences are pretty similar to other languages. The most common ones are: \n - newline \t - tab

We can also format the output by using the iomanip library.

Include it as #include .

Once it is included, you can format output using the iomanip library. For example, we can set the width of an output using the setw command.

    #include <iomanip>

    std::cout<<"\n\nThe text without any formating\n";
    std::cout<<"Ints"<<"Floats"<<"Doubles"<< "\n";
    std::cout<<"\nThe text with setw(15)\n";
    std::cout<<"Ints"<<std::setw(15)<<"Floats"<<std::setw(15)<<"Doubles"<<"\n";
    std::cout<<"\n\nThe text with tabs\n";
    std::cout<<"Ints\t"<<"Floats\t"<<"Doubles"<< "\n";

Output will be:

    The text without any formating
    IntsFloatsDoubles

    The text with setw(15)
    Ints         Floats        Doubles


    The text with tabs
    Ints    Floats    Doubles

### output stream (fstream)

s with other programming languages, we can read and write files.

File IO Steps:

    - Include the <fstream> library 
    - Create a stream (input, output, both)
        - ofstream myfile; (for writing to a file)
        - ifstream myfile; (for reading a file)
        - fstream myfile; (for reading and writing a file)
    - Open the file  myfile.open(“filename”);
    - Write or read the file
    - Close the file myfile.close();
In the next quiz you are going to see the output stream and the input stream in action. Then I want you to play with this program by adding text to the input.txt file and then changing the ifstream and ofstream commands to fstream . Make sure that the text you write is read by the program.

### Header files

Traditionally, these files are called header files and they have an .hpp extension. Although any extension will work.

- Header files contain information about how to do a task.
- The main program contains information about what to do.

### String Input

So, we now know that std::cin will not retrieve strings that have a space in them. It will see the space as the end of the input. We will obviously need a method to enter strings.

C++ has a function called getline. You can find detailed information at the link posted with this video.

The basic form of getline is:

getline: it will retrieve characters from the std::cin source and stores them in the variable called variableName. It will retrieve all characters until the newline or “\n” is detected.

The programmer can also specify a different delimiter if the newline character is not desired. The details are in the provided link.
